											<li>Option 1: A highly detailed photo of Frank is posted in a similar fashion to style guide. This will display how Frank looks like, and some basic stats about him.</li>
											<li>Option 2: A simplified, yet realistic outline of Frank Ocean. Clusters together a couple of basic Frank Ocean stats. This would ideally be placed in the large timeline swirl. Teaches less about what Frank Ocean looks like, but the bold, red lettering of Frank Ocean does discuss what topic the page is about.</li>
											<img src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Appearance3.png" height="400px" style="margin: 2rem 2rem 0 0">In terms of the visual style guide, I match Appearance by applying the same tan-colored theme. This circular shape with Franks' head in a sepia filter dictates him as part of history. Within the same proximity of other heads, this has potential for producing effective relation hierarchies. Lastly, the text is left aligned, and has a clear hierarchy of header and body text, emphasized with an underline in between.</li>
											Appearance tries to match with Bauhaus logo. In addition, numbers and facts around the side provide Number visual language. The font is also in Futura like the infographic's font, and as a san serif typeface, retains the simplicity of Bauhaus.</li>
											<br>The colors emulate the sepia toned feel of the other pictures. This vintage-feeling photo can help evoke thoughts as if Frank Ocean is a timeless artist for this generation. The colors express ubiquity and accessibility, and Frank Ocean possesses both. At the same time, the reds around him will define the avant-garde, maverick themes that Frank is associated with. The colors are emulated 1:1.</li>
											<br>The red establish the maverick themes that Frank is associated with. The logo is intended to be filled with a solid whitespace, and around a dark blue background.</li>

											Despite asking for critiques on the version 1, my critics couldn't find many criticisms for it. Thus, I decided to go with the #2. With the intent of having this be the centerpiece, this logo must clearly indicate that Frank Ocean is the topic of this infographic, while also retain simplified details. I will provide some complementary text above the swirls to increase information as i develop the infographic.
											<br>I did significant revisions, including removing outlines completely, and adding color fills to blank areas. I also added key colors, such as the green hair to represent Frank Ocean's most recognizable form, and colored in his beard to help distinguish his face. The point of the colors was that while the photo has fewer details, the logo retains the Frank Ocean look as the colors can bring up associations with Frank Ocean from his latest studio album "Blonde".
										</p>
										<div>
												In terms of the visual style guide. I did a good attempt at following it. I was able to emulate the swirls, but also put my own creative spin, replacing the swirl to a vinyl record with a tonearm needle. this still retains the abstract, simple style, with simple shapes, and solid colors. The font will be Futura Bold, and is a perfect font to follow as Frank Ocean references Futura in his song "Futura Free". Frank is also a devout fan of design, and I can see many of his aesthetical inspirations coming from Bauhaus, so being able to tie this together is a meaningful, symbolic combination.
												<br>I tried to experiment with some slightly different color combinations, while keeping some of the colors from the original color guide. I wanted to get a background color that complemented the lime green of Frank Ocean's hair, so I tried out a specific hue of blue, which was actually pulled from one of Frank Ocean common color schemes used in promotional materials. Apart from that, I aim to follow very closely to the color guide.
										</div>

										<h2>Second Revision</h2>
										<div>
											<img src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Appearance6.png" height="300px" alt="">
										</div>
											This revised display essentially changes the colors from the previous version. The colors more fit in line with the colors and don't have as harsh of a contrast. The connected red coloring from the vinyl, to the tonearm, to the bottom block add a good, intuitive flow of information, and help keep everything connected, as opposed to last time.
											<br>In addition, the tonearm now has a stripe that's similar to the lines with black lines inside.
											<br>I also made the inside of the circle overlap the gray, making a crescent shape in the inside. This color scheme helps distinguish the gray and the colors, and highlight the logo.
											<br>In terms of the visual style, the objects emulate the one seen in the infographic. However, there is a different in the coloring of the grooves, as they are all white, and a change in the solid line connecting the circle, as it is a tonearm instead. Apart from that, the rest of the objects closely follow the model in terms of color, and vector shape.
											<br>In terms of text, I modeled it after the Bauhaus text on the model. It is a 1:1 modeling, with Futura Font. I had to slightly minimize the type because of the amount of lettering, but this still takes up roughly the same amount of space as Bauhaus does.

										<h3>Option 1</h3>
											<li>Headline show RIAA certification of album/song sales for Frank Ocean.</li>
											<li>The number of discs count as 1 unit, and the baseline unit is in parentheses on the right.</li>
											<li>Converted image to greyscale and then brought up the respective colors of gold, or added more whites. This produced a monotoned color that was much more in line with the infographic model</li>
											<li>Leveraging visual potential, I used an isotype numbers visual to illustrate this data. I felt it appropriate because it still leverages motifs of music with the vinyl records. To visualize the count or frequency of sales, I made the vinyl records counts, all neatly organized and stacked together. There are also units on the side to distinguish the difference in colors. I do realize that the gold certified does have as much weighting as the platinum, with the same size, it's stack on top, and it's an even more prominent color scheme, which could be contentious point that I would like to see critique on.</li>
											<li>This second piece represents the grammy wins that Frank has won.</li>
											<li>This is shown in the header, and each grammy has a subtitle showing what category, what music/album, and what year.</li>
											<li>I also used the grammy awards to signify the count.</li>

										<br><h3>Option 2</h3>
											<li>This is a mixture of isotype and pie chart.</li>
											<li>Instead of count, these are used for the ratio between different awards.</li>
											<li>RIAA certifications has a key and is color coded using generic RIAA vinyl</li>
											<li>Grammy is color coded based on success rate.</li>
											<li>I also applied a grayscale and added some color, this produced an effect I like, similar to the sepia-toned images. I was conflicted with whether to use a silhouette or a real image. A silhouette wouldn't really fit the model of the infographic, while a real image might be too realistic. Using a real image with filtering of colors decreases details of the image, while grayscaling helps to highlight out the outline of the image, similar to a silhouette.</li>
											<li>A simplified, yet realistic outline of Frank Ocean. Clusters together a couple of basic Frank Ocean stats. This would ideally be placed in the large timeline swirl. Teaches less about what Frank Ocean looks like, but the bold, red lettering of Frank Ocean does discuss what topic the page is about.</li>

										Views should instantly recognize the dotted backdrop as a dotted world map. The viewers will also see the pictures of various studios, with a header that says "Studios" on the top left. The pictures have annotations that show the album that was worked on in the studio, studio name, and studio location. Leader lines point up to the area that the studio is located in, with an outlined endpoint to mark the spot.
										<br>While each of the pictures have different sizes, their annotations are all the same font size. The difference in picture size is merely the aspect ratio of the pictures, and so the text will help to show that each of these locations are equally weighted and have no distinguishing hierarchy. The sepia overlay is also used to describe some form of uniformity in that they are all studios. Leading lines were created by moving studios in a way that wouldn't make the line clip into the pictures. The white lines complement the white text, and mix together with the annotations, to show a direct linear relationship between the location to the location at the other end of the line.

									</div>
									<p><b>Graphic takeaway</b>
										<br>For Option #1, I learned how many different genres and subgenres Frank Ocean has performed in his music. We see the primary genres, or generally just genres, such as hip hop, rock, r&b, etc. and those are then color-coded and subdivided into alternative, classic, contemporary, etc forms of the primary genre. This extends out to more obscure genres in the third rung.
										<br>For Option #2, I learned about the relationships that Frank has had in the music industry, which artists he has collaborated with. The lines easily guide me to each artist and shows me the albums Frank has worked on.​

										<br><br><b>Exploiting relationship visual potential</b>
										<br>For Option #1, each rung is notated with a Primary, Secondary, Tertiary. More importantly, the rungs help encode each genre in a hierarchy, complemented by the text. The colors, while they don't have a codified meaning to them, are used to encode classification of genres. The white lines all help to separate genres, and include several subgenres together. The rungs interact by not fusing into each other, again, distinguishing the levels apart. The lines do touch to give meaning that they are each related in some way, and the strength of the lines, help to constantly distinguish genres.
										<br>For Option #2, this one is a bit more intuitive. Figures are all in circular shapes of the same size and color, to promote the idea that each of these entities are equal, or just musicians in this case. There is a small hierarchy, as the graph shows Frank's own collabs, so Frank becomes the peak, and everyone else is connected to him. The lines provide guidance and interaction between other artists, with text to describe the interaction.</p>

									<h2>First Revision (Option 2)</h2>
									<img class="image left" src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Relationship4.png" height="100%" alt=""/>
									<li>Separated the Frank Ocean section to its own section.</li>
									<li>Both have a tan background, Frank Ocean, being the focus of the infographic, does have a white outline to evoke more salience than the collab block. The tan coloring helps to creating a grouping effect despite being physically separated.</li>
									<li>Together, these blocks provide a relation of artists Frank Ocean has collaborated with.</li>
									<li>The Frank Ocean block also goes well by itself displaying a basic biography of Frank Ocean, stationed up in the infographic. This is near the eye-catching vinyl record and title, where eyes would most likely start at. </li>
									<li>Overall, a very close 1:1 emulation, with some slight differences.</li>
									<li>Typeface is Futura Bold, -25 tracking. Same as before.</li>
									<li>Lines are completely removed to remove that unnecessary hierarchy between collab artists, instead, placement and distance is used to distinguish Frank Ocean from collab artists.</li>
									<li>Decreased opacity by 5% to give the pictures a more faded look, and make them appear brighter.</li>
									<li>For the Frank Ocean block, I added text in the relatively same areas. I did slightly stray with the picture and the annotations, given that I did not use a rectangular picture of Frank, and wanted to fill up the negative space.</li>
									<li>Colors are exact emulations.</li>
									<li>Tan for the backgrounds, blue for the picture outlines.</li>
									<li>For the background block outlines, the model conveniently uses a white outline for the top right block to highlight that specific block--this is conveniently where I placed Frank Ocean's information, and perfectly fits as the natural spot to look at once the viewer looks over the vinyl record title.</li>
									<br>

									<h2>Second Revision (Option 2)</h2>
									<img class="image right" src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Relationship5.png" height="100%" alt=""/>
									<li>Because the criticisms were fixed on the first revision, the revisions on this version were much more subtle to help it model the style guide.</li>
									<li>Firstly, while there is no hierarchy of personnel on the collab section, viewers are more easily to see certain areas of the block. As a result, I placed more prominent figures up at the easier to read section of the Collab block, like the top, and put less notable/less frequently collab'd artists near the bottom.</li>
									<li>Many viewers noticed how thick the vectors were underneath the text compared to the model. I switched from 1.25~ pt strokes down to .25 stocks for every vector.</li>
									<li>I switched from 1.25~ pt strokes down to .25 stocks for every vector.</li>
									<li>Type is the same type, sizing is very similar</li>
									<li>Placement of circles uniform and emulates model</li>
									<li>Circles, outlines, lines are all in line with model</li>
									<li>Colors are in line</li>
									<li>Sepia tone filtering</li>
									<li>Color of block, outline, and vectors are all matching. Tan, blue, black respectively.</li>

									<div>
										<img class="image main" src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Time1.png" height:"200px" alt="">
									</div>
										<b>Option #1</b>
										<li>This is the 'works' section of Frank Ocean, cataloguing his discography from his first mixtape, to his latest collabs and singles.</li>
										<li>There are coded bullets to mention whether the work is an album, mixtape, single, or feature. These bullets underneath the album art also resembles that of a track listing for an album, evoking the motif of music and music discographies.</li>
										<li>This is also depicted with a hierarchy of differing sizes in album art shape--the largest ones are albums/mixtapes, the smaller ones are singles, and the smallest are features, while all of them keep some square form to indicate a relation. </li>
										<li>There are dates with a line to show which year they were released in, in helvetica font next to the annotations, there is a more specific annotation with the month/year release. Evidently, the library is chronologically ordered as well, with a left to right flow.</li>
										<br>
									<div>
										<img class="image main" src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Time2.png" height:"200px" alt="">
									</div>
										<b>Option #2</b>
										<li>This 'works' section has a more simple approach than the first one.</li>
										<li>Viewers should take away the various albums, singles, features, that are on the timeline from left to right. They should also see the gap in time from 2014 to 2016, which is meant to signify Frank Ocean's sabbatical.</li>
										<li>In terms of visual potential, the album arts are stacked in their respective years, to follow some form of date grouping. </li>
										<li>The equal year spacing also brings out a dichotomy, that is, the time elapse of 2014 to 2016, in contrast to the loaded amounts of music on other areas of the timeline. </li>
										<br>

									<h2>First Revision (Option 1)</h2>
										<img class="image main" src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Time3.png" height:"200px" alt="">
										<b>Revisions added:</b>
										<li>Moved up 'works' text</li>
										<li>Added key for artwork sizing, dashed lines with several squares</li>
										<li>Moved down title annotations to vertically spread the content</li>
										<li>Moved down vector lines next to years, used to point down to the annotations</li>
										<li>Changed type of dates from Helvetica to Futura</li>
										<li>Added distinct parentheses on dates</li>
										<li>Increased font size from 2pt to 2.5pt</li>
										<li>Removed italics from Albums annotations, back to Futura Bold at 3pt font</li>
										<li>Removed year in date annotations, added day</li>

										<b>Visual potential:</b>
										<li>It should also explain how this revised display is continuing to exploit the visual potential of time.</li>
										<li>This still exploits the visual potential of time by evenly spacing out groupings of time. The annotations with the month and day, combined with the year help evoke a chronological salience. Library is chronologically ordered as well, with a left to right flow.</li>

										<b>Additional Changes:</b>
										<li>Typeface is Futura Bold, -25 tracking. Same.</li>
										<li>Utilized only Futura font. Removed the helvetica for the sake of consistency with the model.</li>
										<li>Increased font size from 2 to 2.5pt to make it more readable and closer to the sizing of the body text found in the model.</li>
										<li>The block is the same shape</li>
										<li>Block is of the same color and fits the model guide.</li>
										<li>Type color is the same, white.</li>
										<li>The photos do not have an aged filter, similar to the model itself.</li>

									<br><h1>Layout</h1>
									<h3>First Draft</h3>
									<div>
										<img class="image right" src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Layout1.png" height="500px" alt="">
									</div>
										<b>Option #1</b>
										<br><b>Arrangement</b>
										<li>There is top-down, horizontal layout to this model. The main placement of the circular rings with "Frank Ocean" are meant to catch the viewer's attention. Starting from there, we see leading lines that lead you towards the right and towards the median block which is also red. From the median, we eventually reach the bottom sections. The viewer would be looking left to right throughout, and gradually make his/her way down the graphic. The 30 slant provides a contrast from the left side to the right side, and pushes viewers to view it left to right much more than the second one. </li>

										<b>Grouping</b>
										<li>The location of blocks between the median have distinguishing information displayed. The top blocks denotes Frank Ocean, such as his age, biography, accomplishments, while the bottom displays information about personnel, genres, and studio locations, things that are less central to Frank Ocean and of less direct importance. The middle median is a meeting point of both blocks; Frank Ocean's discography is associated with all of the surrounding blocks, like his biography, his accolades, and also the genres, people he's worked with, and studios.</li>

										<b>Size of elements</b>
										<li>Similar to the grouping, the largest blocks on top denote the history of Bauhaus, whereas the smaller blocks on the bottom display personnel, courses, and locations. This variation in size implies that the bottom blocks are complementary to the top blocks in terms of information.</li>

										<img src="images/FrankOceanInfographic/Layout2.png" height="500px" alt="">
										<b>Option #2</b>
										<br><b>Arrangement</b>
										<li>This graphic also has a top-down horizontal layout. The main visual 'hook' is still the vinyl record with Frank Ocean's face. The large text "the storied career of" and "Frank Ocean", and the accolades are all very visible and encircle the vinyl record. This vinyl record then leads us from the left to the right side of the graphic, we see Frank's bio block, and further down to the main median block. The median block would move from left to right, and downwards to the remaining graphics below. Compared to the first layout model, the horizontal effect of the layout is less pronounced. By making the blocks more rectangular rather than slanted or cut-out, the dynamic seems to have more horizontal effects, and can be seen much easier at a glance. </li>

										<b>Grouping</b>
										<li>The grouping is very similar to the first one. The top blocks denotes Frank Ocean, such as his age, biography, accomplishments, while the bottom displays information about personnel, genres, and studio locations, things that are less central to Frank Ocean and of less direct importance. </li>

										<b>Size of elements</b>
										<li>Some of the elements have also been scaled up to show text better, however; this can confusingly connote importance of the blocks. This is especially apparent with the location display and the collabs display, as they flipped in sizing. It seems as if the recording studios provide much more insight than they actually do.</li>
