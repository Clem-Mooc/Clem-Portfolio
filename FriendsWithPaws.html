								<!-- product goals -->
								<h1>Product Goals</h1>
								<h2>Scope of the Application</h2>
								<p>To compete in the pet finder app market, we must roll out features that have instant accessibility, rivaling that of the current competitors, such as PetFinder. Conversely, we must differentiate and propose unique value to convince customers to switch over to our application. As a result, we will be rolling out a mixture of the most-essential core functions offered in pet applications, and the most-valuable unique features offered only on FriendsWithPaws.

								<br><br>For core features, we will release an accessible, pick-up-and-go app that rivals that of PetFinder’s main value proposition: a sophisticated search feature to filter for pets. As such, we will provide robust ‘search’ feature similar to PetFinder’s search function, which will aggregate and filter for pets with certain characteristics.

								<br><br>In providing unique value, we also need to differentiate our product significantly from the popular pet finding apps. We will need to roll out valuable and unique features not found in other apps, and prompt new users to download FriendsWithPaws instead of PetFinder. Features prioritized to roll out will be the ‘Compatibility Score’, and ‘Pet Shelter Activities Bulletin Board’. </p>

								<h2>Prototype Build Features</h2>
								App features will be separated into two epics: adoption process and user retention.

								<br><b>ADOPTION PROCESS:</b> With FriendsWithPaws, we aim to bring together prospective pet owners with a streamlined adoption process. Users will be enabled to discover the right pet with a user's desired characteristics and schedule appointments with pet shelters.

								<br><b>USER RETENTION:</b> In addition to finding the right pet, we believe the pet-owning process does not stop there. Adopting a pet is a wholehearted and emotional responsibility, and we provide an arsenal of community-based features to empower users even after finding a pet. Users can open FriendsWithPaws to find a myriad of crowd-sourced insights, such as guides on pet care, pet workshops, volunteering, and lost pets around the area.

								<br><br>
								<b>Must (MVP)</b>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Compatibility Score:</b> We assess new users with a comprehensive Pet Personality Quiz. By assessing the user, and also the pets that are put up for adoption, we will create an algorithmic compatibility score based on factors such as lifestyle, energy, size, etc.</li>
									<li><b>Filter Search:</b> Tapping on the search bar within the application will reveal a taskbar of filter characteristics based on the data collected from pets. Users can fine tune their searches by tapping on the filter taskbar again, which enables them to have precise control over the pet they are looking for.</li>
									<li><b>Scheduling:</b> Prospective adopters who find a pet listing they are interested in can tap on a pet’s profile. Users should also be able to access contact information, meet and greet hours, and upcoming shelter workshop events to meet shelter employees or ask questions. Deciding on the right pet can be selective and exhaustive, and we want to give users the most time looking at pets, rather than scheduling for them. We include hours and contact information within the app so users don’t have to scour confusing websites in search of this information.</li>
								</ul>

								<b>Should</b>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Foster Program:</b> All users will tap on a listing and should see an icon on the pet profile indicating that it is available for fostering. Users can also filter for pets that have this ‘Foster’ trait in their pet searches. Allowing users to “try out” a pet before making the big commitment  will make adoption more accessible to potential pet adopters and increases the likelihood of a good match. PetFinder currently posts guides on fostering pets but does not provide functionality in arranging one. We will compile current foster programs that are provided by pet shelters. Additionally we will create an intuitive ‘Foster Pet Program Form’ for pet shelters to fill out.</li>
									<li><b>Pet Shelter Activities Bulletin Board:</b> Some users who adopt pets already have a strong affinity with pets and sheltering. We want to organize and display information, such as volunteering opportunities, internships, and promotional sales events about each pet shelter organization, all centered around the user’s location. Users who are active pet owners will be able to log into FriendsWithPaws and browse a virtual bulletin board with event information tailored to their locations. If a user wants to inquire more about an event, he or she will tap on the specific listing and see more details, including time, place, and description. If the user has further questions, the user can tap on the shelter/company associated with the list posting and ask questions directly.</li>
								</ul>

								<b>Could</b>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Lost and Found Bulletin Board:</b> With a community of connected pet owners in the user's localized neighborhood, we provide a bulletin for lost pets around the area. Lost pet users can upload their pet characteristics on a ‘Lost Pet Form’, such as name, coating, and tracking chip. This information entry provides more information than conventional methods and is highly visible to the community radius. Lost and found posts are also sharable on major social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, to easily provide maximum exposure, with the most of amount of information about the lost pet.</li>
									<li><b>Spotlight Stories:</b> We want to be able to share success stories that come as a result of matching a user with a new pet. There will be a dedicated page for displaying information such as adoption rate statistics and a weekly newsletter showcasing a perfect match between pet and owner. Reading through users’ positive experiences with FriendsWithPaws will encourage new users to try it out.</li>
									<li><b>Pet Guides:</b> We provide an extensive blog of guides and articles for prospective adopters, current pet owners, and those looking to put a pet up for adoption. Guides such as "Dog Adoption Checklist", "Cat Nutrition", and "Steps to meet a pet in-person" are provided to help inform users.</li>
									<li>Overall, FriendsWithPaws provides value not only to consumers but also to shelters by facilitating the progress towards their mission of fighting animal homelessness. These features will strengthen their social responsibility positioning to the public and has the potential to gain new supporters.</li>
								</ul>

								<!-- business goals -->
								<h1>Business Goals</h1>
								<h2>Long-Term Goals</h2>
								<p>The goal of our app is to successfully match pets in shelters with owners and give both the pet and owner long-term happiness. By reducing the chances of a mismatch, which results in returning the pet to the shelter, we will also be reducing the animal shelter population. We hope to provide a holistic lifestyle identifier to our app, and to foster a strong community between adopters and pet shelters alike, with the goal to keep users engaged in the app even after adopting a pet.</p>

								<h2>The Value to End Users</h2>
								<p>Our product helps the user find the right pet for themselves, their family, or their friends. Having a pet will help reduce loneliness and stress, increase socialization and happiness, and provide emotional support. Additionally, our product will help reduce the number of animals without a home. This provides users peace of mind, moral self-esteem, and it reduces the cost of homeless animals on society. Finally, our product will save people time by finding the right pet for them the first time. Finding the right pet can be challenging and exhausting, with visits to many shelters, negotiations with people and paperwork, and sometimes pets who don’t fit with their lifestyles.</p>

								<h2>Users</h2>
								<p>Our application will match prospective pet owners with pet shelters. Groups that will be interacting with our product include prospective pet owners, pet shelter employees, employees who support the application, and sponsors.

								<br><br> <b>Primary users</b> include prospective pet owners who will be sharing their preferences in hopes of finding a pet suitable for their lifestyle. Prospective owners will indicate their preferences and browse through pet profiles based on the information received. Another feature will allow them to see volunteer opportunities, including pet fostering. We are especially interested in prospective pet owners who want to ‘foster’ a pet because it essentially lets volunteers “try out” a pet before making the big commitment and increases the likelihood of a good match. Pet shelter employees are also primary users as they will be posting available pets on the app and advertising them. They will also evaluate the pet’s characteristics and accurately provide the characteristics on the application. Prospective pet owners will access FriendsWithPaws through the mobile application, and pet shelters will access FriendsWithPaws through the website.

								<br><br> <b>Secondary users</b> include people who support the application and help resolve issues that primary users find when using the application. Employees who support the application will also be involved in incorporating sponsors into the applications. We are considering a feature that would track shelter population and rate of adoption for use by government and media organizations. Government and media organizations would use the app to get this information, making them secondary users.

								<br><br> <b>Tertiary users</b> include sponsors. Sponsors can sponsor individual pets toward adoption, especially those that have been in shelters for a long time. They can also give out promotional codes to new pet owners. Journalists would also be tertiary users. They create publicity for the application, but are unlikely to use the application. However, they may use the application to find success stories to use in their news stories. We are also considering implementing ‘success stories’ as part of our app’s blog, which could stream in content for journalists, and provide free brand awareness and publicity.</p>

								<h2>Primary Target Demographic</h2>
								<p>Our primary target demographic will be young adults between the ages of 18-35; research that suggests that people in this age group are most likely to be pet owners (Cullen).

								<br><br>Additionally, 54% of adults from this demographic responded that the main role of their pet is as a best friend (Cullen). Adults in this category will likely be out of school and working full-time jobs, which gives them little to no time to search for a new addition to their families. Our application will aid pet owners in finding a new best friend that matches their preferences the most and will decrease the chances of picking a pet that does not fit their lifestyles. </p>

								<h2>Current Solutions</h2>
								<p>There are several alternatives on the market. However, the quality in website UI and features vary significantly from website to website. Ergo, there are only a handful of apps and websites with an adequate amount of features, functionality, and sizeable user base. The top competitors are WeRescue, PetFinder, and PawsLikeMe.

								<br><br>WeRescue is the premier mobile app for finding pets. The user interface is very similar to those of dating sites such as Tinder and allows users to swiftly look through pets, favorite pets they like, and read a description of each pet (WeRescue). WeRescue emphasizes its aesthetically sharp app, crisp, full size pictures, and modern UI (WeRescue). It promotes an aesthetical quality that is unmatched by other applications (WeRescue).

								<br><br>Additionally, the search function is extensive. You can search for pets based on zip code and pet characteristics such as breed, age, and color (WeRescue). Pet profiles include several pictures, and an exhaustive list of pet characteristics, including coat length and declawed status (WeRescue).

								<br><br>Another competitor, Petfinder, is very similar to WeRescue, but is solely based on a website platform (“Petfinder”). One of the first pet adoption websites, having been formed 22 years ago, Petfinder has become a for-profit company owned by Nestle, and benefits from being a first-mover in this market (“Petfinder”). The application design has a clear, uniform color scheme in line with the branding of Petfinder, while offering a clean, modern user experience (Petfinder).

								<br><br>A unique competitive factor for Petfinder is that rather than solely focusing on dogs and cats, adoptive parents are also able to search for other pets such as fish, birds, rabbits, small furry animals, horses, and barnyard animals (Petfinder). Moreover, Petfinder promotes a clear mission-oriented lifestyle on the website, providing tabs and links to an extensive amount of pet care tips, local volunteering opportunities, and useful information about being a first-time adopter (Petfinder).

								<br><br>These not only help with users already on the website, but it is also great for promoting organic Search Engine Optimization (SEO) search results and reeling in prospective adopters who are searching for general adoption or pet care advice. The search is just as sophisticated as WeRescue as well, with personal information and high-resolution pictures included.

								<br><br>Other unique websites include PawsLikeMe. The unique value proposition is mainly offering a personality quiz to generate a compatibility score and find the right pet for adopters (PawsLikeMe). With an algorithm, PawsLikeMe generates a compatibility score to find a match. However, the website does not appear as polished as the aforementioned two companies, and seems to provide little first-time adopter support and fewer features as well (PawsLikeMe).</p>

								<h2>Actionable Gaps not Addressed by the Current Solution</h2>
								<p>There are some gaps that have not been addressed by current apps, and we think we can provide exclusive value by implementing solutions to these gaps. For instance, we would like to provide a billboard for local volunteering opportunities and upcoming sales and events for shelters, implement a ‘Foster’ program option as a preliminary adoption pathway, and implement an intuitive scheduling feature for meeting with the pets. Some priority ideas include adding blog posts for adoption success stories, and a ‘Lost and Found’ community board. With these features, we hope to foster a strong community between adopters and pet shelters alike, with the ultimate goal to keep users engaged in the app even after adopting a pet.</p>

								<h2>Monetization Plans</h2>
								<p>We will monetize this service by gaining sponsorships from partners who would like to advertise on our application. Sponsors include pet stores, veterinarians, groomers, pet-sitters, or trainers. They will be able to offer promotional codes to new pet owners who begin the adoption process through the application. The pet shelter will be able to use the application to confirm that the adoption process was initiated through the application. Because we collect extensive search data from users, we can parlay this information to Sponsors so they can create highly-specific advertisements relevant to many types of primary users, and develop loyalty for their products. Sponsors will also improve their brand image by being associated with a company that helps find homes for shelter animals.</p>

								<!-- scrum goals -->
								<h1>Scrum Goals</h1>
								<h2>Scrum</h2>
								<p>A service as ambitious as ours has plenty of room to grow. There is so much we can, and would like to, deliver. However, we should focus on what we Must Have in our initial product, what we Should Have soon, and keep in mind what we Could Have as a direction to evolve the product.
									<br>The following is a table of user stories targeting these three categories. Each user story has acceptance criteria we are aiming to achieve to consider a story fulfilled/done and has a User ID to differentiate them.</p>
								<h2>Prototype</h2>
								<p>Our prototype consists of two components. First, a mobile application component for pet seekers, and second, a website interface for shelters.
									<br>The mobile application component is designed to make match-making simple, comprehensive, and intuitive. If a pet seeker is looking for a type of pet or temperament, this application will make that easy to do.
									<a href="https://youtu.be/VAicwBNKss0" class="href">Video: FriendsWithPaws Mobile App</a>
									<br>The website interface component is designed to make posting and updating available pets easy and comprehensive for shelter employees. If there’s an important detail about the pet, they’ll know to include it and be able to do so quickly and intuitively.
									<a href="https://youtu.be/4gNU90NgzAo" class="href">Video: FriendsWithPaws Desktop Website</a>
								</p>
								<h2>Testing</h2>
								<p> After development of the application is finalized, we plan on conducting usability lab studies to monitor how prospective pet owners will engage with the in-app features. An example scenario will be provided to users containing context about wanting to become a new pet owner using FriendsWithPaws. Monitoring this study will allow us to gather data on whether or not users are likely to pick the “Quiz” option as opposed to the “Search” function since our primary goal of the app is to match a user with a “perfect” companion. We will then be able to make changes to the interface as necessary to encourage users to increase their interaction with the “Quiz” selection in order to meet the objective of the app.

									<br>Data collection through application usage will be particularly important to continue providing the best user experience. Information including which features are clicked on most, the type of pet-profile most visited, and results from post-adoption surveys will be collected to see where users spend most of their time and what draws their attention most from the app. Analyzing this data will then allow us to conduct A/B testing, for example, to see if there is a certain type of pet portrait that is most successful in leading to shelter visits or adoptions. Pet shelters may find that pet headshots work less effectively than a picture of the pet lying down or playing, which will be useful so that profiles are created to meet the most common pet profile specification. We will be measuring the number of successful adoption rates after a user clicks on a pet profile as a key performance indicator. Additionally, we will establish a base number of anticipated user profiles created after launch of the app to measure whether or not the app is gaining traction among the community. This will also allow pet shelters to assess if the application is succeeding in booking shelter visits via the app in comparison to pet shelter visits before FriendsWithPaws.</p>
